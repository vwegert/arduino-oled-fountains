# arduino-oled-fountains

This is a small Arduino sketch to display simulated (pyro / water) fountains on an OLED display.
I'm using the [Adafruit SSD1306 library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306) to access
the display. The resulting effect can be seen in [this video](d$Ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKQJzy3EDGw).
